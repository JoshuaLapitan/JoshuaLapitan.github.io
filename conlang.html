<h1>a little idea</h1>
so for a while now i've been thinking of making a conlang. i don't really know how i'm even going to go about doing this, but what i do know is the theme of it: 
i want to make the most literary language. So that sounds really ambitious and vague but i'll try to break it down so that it makes a bit more sense

<h2>requirements</h2>
should be a language that is radical based. needs to be so so that homophones can be easily distinguished and for wordplay to occur. heavy use of Yojijukugo and Chengyu, 
making it a language based in idioms and metaphors. The language should also be tonal to increase the amount of homophones that can be present and increase density. 
make it a non-configurable language so that word order is free, so you can emphasise certain parts of a setence based on how you choose to word your ideas. 
i think i remember something about always naming where you got your infomration from? that could be interesting as wel to further enhance and tie to bodies of literature.
