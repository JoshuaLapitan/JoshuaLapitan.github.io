    <h1>Trainspotting</h1>
    Four minutes before the hour, 
    the train arrives.
    Heralding its own entrance.
    Only for a brief moment 
    it allows itself respite.
    
    People stream in and out
    Carriages overflowing of fish.
    Pigeons perch upon powerlines,
    The trains electrical hum beckons
    But its too heavy to fly.
